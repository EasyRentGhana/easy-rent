Repository for EasyRentGhana

Hello Easy Rent Ghana team, this is a brief description of how this project will be developed.

The webiste will be developed usng html5,css3,php, mySQL and angular js.
The first phase of development will be presented for testing of the user interface across computers and mobile devices.

We could either test it ourselves or make it available to a community of online products testers. We could also test on www.trymyui.com, they are some UI critics and I think we could use that.

As soon as we have our bad ass UI, we will develop a mobile app that matches, the mobile app will be available on two of the most common mobile platforms, the iOS and Android. 

During the testing phase, we will have a large number of fake listings so as to see if everything still runs normally when there is a large database.
